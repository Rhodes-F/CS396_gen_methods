## What do you want the user to feel when using these tools? What mood is this for? What is the user trying to do?

I want the user to have fun. Most of the tools give little to no control so I just want the user to let free and enjoy the doodling

## Describe your eraser. What does it do?

My eraser can be dragged and erases whats below it by putting the area to the color of the background

## Describe your 1st tool. What does it do? How is it used?

-My first tool whcih is the squigle, makes four lines. Two of the lines are colors 0 and 1. the other two depend on where the cursor is when you are drawing.
to use it try changing the colors and drawing, it shoudl make rainbow colors as you circle around the screen

## Describe your 2nd tool. What does it do? How is it used?

The second tool uses the color0 and 1 as well as the slider to draw a little face.
to use it try dragging ur brush around. also try changing the color and size, everything should scale.

## Describe your 3rd tool. What does it do? How is it used?

my third tool draws a boat which changes size based off of the speed you draw.
the tool also draws a bunch of circles below the boat in different shades of blue

## Describe your 4th tool. What does it do? How is it used?

this tool makes zig-zags that change color and a circle. the zigzags are filled in with color 1 while the lines are color 0
to use just move it around.

## Which of your tools is continuous? What makes that different?

my fourth tool is continuouse. it is different because it draws a line using points collected
it then fills in the shape made by the lines. this is different because it doesnt have discrete circlus bu tmany fluid lines

## Which of your tools uses begin/endshape? What are you doing with that feature?

I use begin shape and end shape in the fourth tool aswell. it draws a line using points collected
it then fills in the shape made by the lines
