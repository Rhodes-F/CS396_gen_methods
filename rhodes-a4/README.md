## Which systems behaved like you expected? Which ones surprised you? In which ones did your initial idea evolve into something different?

--your answer here  --
-- Use this answer to remind yourself what you tried and what worked or didn't--
Nothing really behaved like I wanted them to but I am happy wiht ow they all evolved nd I think that it is fun to play with all of them. 



## Describe your 1st system. What forces does it use? What is its emergent behavior?
--your answer here  --
-- If your work is at all close to the example code, be sure to describe how it is different --
-- What techniques and P5 tools did you use? Help the TA/reviewer understand how it works --
This tool is similar to the example code butit generates a a ring of dancer emoji that follow the users mouse. clicking also grabs one of the dancers which allows the user to move it. 


## Describe your 2nd system. What forces does it use? What is its emergent behavior?
--your answer here  --
My second system is very random. it generates a random color for a shape which has been generated. the particles then fall and blow around and follow the users mouse whn clicked. The shapes are supposed to randomly generated but it broke. 

## Describe your 3rd system. What forces does it use? What is its emergent behavior?
--your answer here  --
My 3rd system is a bunch of worms which can be controlled with the arrow keys. they have tails and also change colors depending on their position on screen . The colors go from white to black so the background was chosen as orange to be haloween themed. 

## Describe your 4th system. What forces does it use? What is its emergent behavior?
-- your answer here  --
My fourth system is similar to boirds but the shape has been changed. The colors of the particles also evolves over time. a motion blur was also added. 

## Which system has one particle uses "particle-to-all-particles" forces (Boids style) or reads a map (Braitenberg-style). Explain how.
The fourth system (lightning) uses particle to all particles. This is used when the particles inside are attracted to the larger outer ring of the big particle which is attracted to the mouse. 


## Which system has particles that leave a trail or creates new particles

--your answer here--
-- reminder that the background(0,0,0,.1) trick doesnt count for this --
My third particle(pumpkin) uses this interaction to make a trail of particles. 


## Which system interacts with user behavior, and how?

--your answer here--
-- reminder that drag doesn't count for this --
All of them! The first and fourth systems follow the mouse. The secons system makes forces when the user clicks and the third one uses the arrow keys. 


## List any resources (code, images, etc) you've used, and where you got them from
