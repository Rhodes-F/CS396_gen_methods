## **Generator 1:** what does this generate?

This generates tress with top and trunks that can be changed with the sliders

## What are the most important and interesting qualities of this kind of thing?

I think the most interesting qualities are the randomness but also the fact that a whole forest can be regenerated exactly how I Had it with just a seed or set of parameters
## List your 5+ sliders. Describe what each one controls, and why that is relevant to this

size- scales the top of the tree and leaves (this has been added on to example code)
complexity- the number of spikes on the tree
offset - the offset of the colors in the tree
hue- controls leaf color and top color  (this has been added on to since example code)
hue offset- controls color differences in the trees
lumps- controls tree smoothness
wind - controls the distance the tree top is moved
hight- adjusts the tree height (this is new)
trunk thickness- adjusts trunk thickness (this is new)
bend- adjusts the ammount that the trunk bends and top moves (this is new)


## List your 5+ landmarks. How are they different from each other?

Land mark is the tall yellow tree- its yellow, has a thin trunk and almost no bend. Its also very smooth
"offset rock and roll tree": thsi tree is large and spikey with a purple color scheme
"tiny blue tree": this tree is very small and blue
"comment tree": This tree is orange and red and spike facing one side
"leaning hear tree": this tree is leaning very far to the left and has a small pink heart as the top 
## For a generator of this type of thing, what kinds of things *can't* it generate?
it can only generate trees in a loraxesque style so it cant generate realistic trees or boxes or circels or faces or anything it wasnt designed for

## What was hard or easy about making this generator? How did your plans change?
I had a realtivly hard time making this generator and initially planned to have it be a collection of the spike balls but coudlnt get it to work so I made them into trees

## **Generator 2:** what does this generate?

This makes circles and elipses
## What are the most important and interesting qualities of this kind of thing?

you can make fun polka dots 
## List your 5+ sliders. Describe what each one controls, and why that is relevant to this

"size": size of the elipse
"aspectRatio": the height vs the width 
"hue":hue in the color of circles in HSL
"brightness": brightness of the color 
"bounce": the heigth of the bounces of the circles


## List your 5+ landmarks. How are they different from each other?

tennisball: its small bouncing and yellow
      basketball: its orange large perfectly round and bouncing
      "it dissapeared":nothing shows up 
      football:its brown and oval shaped in the wide direction
      "tall bule circle that doesn't move":its tall ligth blue and doesnt bounce

## For a generator of this type of thing, what kinds of things *can't* it generate?

- it can only make elipses so it cant make corners or pictures or more complex shapes

## What was hard or easy about making this generator? How did your plans change?

this was pretty easy to make but I learned the limitations of the sliders and generation whcih helped me later

## Which generator has a more interesting possibility space?

the first one
