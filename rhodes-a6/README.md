## What states does this bot move through? Is this a common social script? Why do the states connect like that?

origin> either any of the inputs or if it takes too long waiting which will remind the user how to use the bot> the user can from there select any of the recomended inputs or if they type they will be promted to select the recomended responses. 

This script is relativly common. I chose for all the states to be connected so the user could see many options based on times and woudl not get stuck in a hole where they woudl have to refresh



## In what ways does your bot obey or subvert the Gricean maxims

My bot obeys both quantity and manner. It is always very informatve and also helps the user to stay on track. If the user is off track the bot will suggest a way for the to get back on track. 

## What 3 other bots did you look at? What was interesting, notable or useful about them?

I used the T-mobil bot. I think it was sucessful in finding ways to search the website and get the information faster. 

I used the united bot. Thsi bot was over text but was not very helpfull becasue it often linked to external pages and would not pair down the information

I used the amazon help bot which I think was also good at finding specifics abotu certain policies like returns.
