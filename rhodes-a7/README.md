I am showing the temperature but I have also scaled the color of each circle so that it gets warmer as the temperture increases. This shows a visual comparrsion of temperature as colors for the week

## What did you notice about this data that you didn't anticipate?

I think the weather data was pretty self explanetory. The website for this api was also very helpful 
## What do you want the visitor to your page to understand about this data?

I want them to be able to see the current temperature then get a prediction for the highs and lows fo rthe rest of the week. The colors shoudl help them make a trend. For example, right noe it is very cold and it is supposed to get colder but then warmer
